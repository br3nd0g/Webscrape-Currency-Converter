# Webscrape-Currency-Converter

A small program written to scrape currency conversion data from https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/ using the urllib import.

It accepts two inputs from the user, the currency to convert from and the currency to convert to (in the form of "GBP" or "USD"), then returning the converted value by scraping the webpage for the data.

## Next Steps

To allow the actual full name such as "British Pounds" to be entered, and to allow any amount to be entered, such as 1000 swedish krona.
